# Housing-Price-Prediction

This project utilizes Iowa's Housing dataset, which provides comprehensive information on residential properties in Ames and Des Moines, Iowa, to develop accurate predictive models for house prices. Since Des Moines is the largest populated city in Iowa, so I chose this dataset. Key features selected for analysis include "Heating," "HeatingQC," "GrLivArea," "SalePrice," "BedroomAbvGr," "KitchenQual," "GarageCars," "GarageQual," and "WoodDeckSF." Categorical variables are converted to numerical values to facilitate exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model building. By drawing on previous research and methodologies, including Gusthema's Kaggle kernel and studies on housing price determinants by Deng et al. and DiPasquale and Wheaton, this project aims to enhance the understanding of housing price dynamics in Lowa. To enhance model performance, I conducted hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation. The final model achieved a high degree of accuracy and demonstrated robust predictive capabilities. The results of this study can assist real estate professionals, potential buyers, and policymakers in making informed decisions regarding property investments and pricing strategies.
